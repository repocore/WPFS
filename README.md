## Description

Web Project Folder Structure
This platform is a folder structure created for web designers and developers who work with languages like HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and their libraries and frameworks in the field of development and programming. And it’s designed so that there’s no need to spend time on naming and creating a structure for folders, preventing developers and programmers from getting confused during the naming and folder organization process.
First point: An index file with an html extension is included in the project so that there are no issues in the front-end coding.
Second point: If you want to use libraries and frameworks, I suggest creating a folder within each language’s folder according to your needs and placing the related files there.
